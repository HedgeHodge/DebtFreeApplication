# Debt Free Cloud Application

This project is being worked on as part of my final project for the Microsoft-sponsored MSSA Cloud Application Developer cohort hosted by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

## Background

Debt is something many of us live with and often times we don’t see a way to get out of it. The reality is, if we don’t do something about it, it usually piles up until we have no choice but to confront it. Growing up, I wasn’t taught good money management skills and as a result, I let myself get into far too much debt for my own good. I came across the idea of the Debt Snowball, which is the concept that you list your debts smallest to largest and you tackle the smallest one first. This way, as you pay off each small debt, you gain a boost of confidence as you knock them out one by one. The bonus to this is that you also take out a monthly payment that can be added onto your payment for the next debt, hence “The Debt Snowball”. 

## Overview

This application will provide a simple and functional UI that gives you a snapshot of your debts and allows you to work on the next smallest debt one-at-a-time. While I want this application to provide a good bit of functionality, my main focus is on providing motivation to continue making payments towards your debts.

## Functionality

With this application, you will have the ability to register using Email and Password, Google Authentication, or Apple Authentication. After signing in for the first time, you will be presented with a page to enter all of your debts. After you finish entering all your debts, you will arrive at the main page. The main page will consist mostly of a Donut chart to view all debts, a simple list view of the selected debt, and a plus button to add a payment.

## Deployment

This project will be deployed on the Azure platform.
